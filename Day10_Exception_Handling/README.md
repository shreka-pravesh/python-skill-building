Day 10 – Exception Handling

This folder contains programs that handle common runtime errors gracefully using try-except blocks.

What is Exception Handling?

Exception handling in Python is a way to deal with errors in your program without crashing it.
Instead of stopping suddenly when something goes wrong, Python lets you catch the error and handle it gracefully.

Why it’s useful

> Prevents your program from crashing.
> Makes your code safer and more user-friendly.
> Helps you understand what went wrong.

Programs Included

Concepts Covered

- Handling runtime errors with `try`, `except`, and `finally`  
- Using multiple exception types for specific cases  
- Raising custom exceptions manually
