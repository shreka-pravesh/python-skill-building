Day 18 – File & Data Utilities

Focuses on real-world utility programs — the kind of tools you might actually use on your own system.
Each program introduces useful Python concepts like file handling, data serialization (JSON), encryption, and automation logic.

New Concepts Learned

JSON Handling (json module):

-> JSON is a lightweight format to store and exchange structured data.
-> It’s widely used in APIs, settings, and data files because it’s both human- and machine-readable.
-> Random Data Generation (random module):
     Helps simulate real scenarios like generating random test data, OTPs, or weather results.
-> Datetime Operations (datetime module):
     Used to fetch, format, and calculate dates or timestamps for logs and reports.

Programs

1️. smart_email_sorter.py

Concept: Automatically separates incoming emails into folders (Work, Personal, Promotions) based on keywords.
Highlight: Demonstrates string parsing and smart text-based classification using simple logic.

2️. quote_manager.py

Concept: Manages a collection of motivational quotes—add, view, or fetch a random one.
Highlight: Focuses on persistent storage using text files and random data handling.

3️. file_backup_tool.py

Concept: Creates automatic timestamped backups of important files or folders.
Highlight: Introduces file handling and system path management using os and shutil.

4️. file_encryption.py

Concept: Encrypts the content of a text file using simple cipher logic.
Highlight: Teaches encoding/decoding and how data can be obfuscated for safety.

5️. file_decryption.py

Concept: Decrypts encrypted text files created by the encryption program.
Highlight: Reinforces modular design—where decryption logic mirrors the encryption module.

6. Bonus – mini_weather_fetcher.py (Upgraded)

Concept: Simulates a 3-day weather forecast for any city with random data.
Highlight: Combines random, json, and datetime modules to imitate a real API and generate, display, and save structured reports.

Summary

* I learned to build utility-based tools that handle real-world data—like text files, backups, or reports.
* You explored data safety (encryption), structured storage (JSON), and automation (datetime + random).
* These skills form the foundation for more advanced applications like data analysis, API integration, and system automation.
