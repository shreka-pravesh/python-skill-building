Day 16 – Data Handling

This folder focuses on how Python handles, reads, and stores data using files like text, CSV, and JSON.
Each program helps you understand how to work with real-world datasets and store information in an organized, reusable way.


What is Data Handling?

Data Handling means collecting, storing, and managing data so that it can be used easily and efficiently.
In Python, it involves reading and writing data from files (like text, CSV, or JSON) and organizing it for analysis or reuse.

1. What is a CSV file?

A CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file is a simple text file where data is stored in table form — each line is a row, and values are separated by commas.
It’s commonly used for spreadsheets, reports, and exporting data between systems.

2. What is a JSON file?

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight format used to store and share structured data.
It’s human-readable and widely used in APIs, web apps, and configuration files.
