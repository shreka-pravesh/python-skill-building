Day 17 – File Automation & Utility Tools


What is File Automation?

File automation means using Python to handle file-related tasks automatically — like renaming, sorting, cleaning, or organizing — without manual effort.
It saves time and reduces errors while managing multiple files efficiently.

Programs Included

1️. auto_file_renamer.py

Renames all files in a folder with a chosen prefix and date.
Concept: Uses os and datetime for dynamic, automated file renaming.

2️. file_metadata_extractor.py

Extracts each file’s name, size, and type into a CSV report.
Concept: Combines os, csv, and datetime for metadata analysis.

3️. log_cleaner.py

Cleans log files by removing empty lines and symbols.
Concept: Demonstrates text sanitization and file rewriting in Python.

4️. folder_statistics.py

Scans folders to show total files, subfolders, and total size.
Concept: Uses os.walk() to summarize folder structure and usage.

5️. archive_manager.py

Creates or extracts .zip archives easily.
Concept: Demonstrates real-world automation with zipfile.

6. file_organizer_pro.py

Automatically organizes files by type, creates backups, and logs activity.
Concept: Combines os, shutil, datetime, and logging to manage folders like a pro.

Concept Summary

This day focuses on real-world automation and system scripting in Python.
Learned how to clean, rename, back up, and organize files using libraries like os, csv, zipfile, shutil, and log
