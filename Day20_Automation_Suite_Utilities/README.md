Python Automation Suite – Pro-Level Utilities

This folder contains five advanced Python projects designed to improve productivity, automate daily tasks, and demonstrate professional-level programming concepts — including file handling, data visualization, APIs, and smart automation.

1. Project Manager Pro

Purpose: Helps manage multiple projects efficiently by storing tasks, due dates, and statuses in a structured format.

  Features:
   * Create, update, and view project details
   * Task prioritization and progress tracking
   * Automatic time-stamp for each entry

  Concepts Used:
   > File handling (JSON/CSV)
   > Date & time modules
   > Dynamic user input

2. Email Report Generator

  Purpose: Automatically compiles and formats performance data into a structured email-style report for easy review.

  Features:
   8 Reads summary data from files
   * Generates formatted text or HTML reports
   * Simulates sending via console

  Concepts Used:
   > String formatting & templating
   > File reading/writing
   > Automation workflow design

3. Data Trend Analyser

  Purpose: Analyzes datasets and visualizes trends to help identify growth or decline patterns over time.

  Features:
   * Accepts CSV data input
   * Generates trend summaries (average, min, max)
   * Visual plots using matplotlib

  Concepts Used:
   > Data visualization
   > Statistical computation
   > External library usage

4. Habit Streak Tracker

  Purpose: Helps users build consistency by tracking daily habits and maintaining streak counts automatically.

  Features:
   * Logs daily habit entries
   * Calculates streaks dynamically
   * Stores data in JSON for persistence

  Concepts Used:
   > JSON file operations
   > Date handling with datetime
   > Data persistence

 5. System Cleaner Simulator

  Purpose: Simulates scanning and cleaning temporary system files for a fun, realistic command-line experience.

  Features:
   * Fake system scan animation
   * Random temporary file generation
   * Progress-bar style cleaning simulation

  Concepts Used:
   > Randomization
   > Time-based simulation (time.sleep())
   > Console output formatting
