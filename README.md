🐍 Python Skill Building

Hi, I’m Shreka 👋
Welcome to my Python Skill Building repository — a place where I’m learning, practicing, and improving my Python skills through consistent coding.

🎯 About This Repository

This repo is part of my 20-day Python challenge, where I’m building 100 simple and human-friendly programs — 5 each day.

My goal is to focus on clarity, structure, and understanding, rather than just writing complex algorithms.
Every script here is written in my own words with clear comments and easy-to-follow logic.

> “Good code isn’t about showing off — it’s about making things understandable.”
