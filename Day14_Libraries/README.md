Day 14 – Python Libraries 

In Python, a library is a collection of ready-made code — functions, classes, and modules — that help you perform specific tasks without writing everything from scratch.

Think of it like a toolbox  — each tool (library) solves a different type of problem:
   >> Need math formulas? → use math
   >> Work with files or folders? → use os or shutil
   >> Handle dates or times? → use datetime
   >> Want to automate patterns? → use itertools
   >> Build data apps? → use pandas, numpy, etc.

 Why Use Libraries?

 * Saves time — no need to reinvent existing solutions.
 * Reliable — tested and maintained by experts.
 * Readable & clean — code looks shorter and more professional.
 * Powerful — lets you handle advanced tasks with simple functions.


Programs

1. math_toolbox.py — Interactive math menu using math functions.  
2. date_planner.py — Add or compare dates using 'datetime'.  
3. file_sorter.py — Auto-sort files into folders using 'os' and 'shutil'.  
4. pattern_generator.py  — Create and save text patterns using "itertools".  
5. personal_event_calendar.py  — Bonus mini project using 'calendar', 'datetime', and 'json'.


Concepts Learned

- Real-world use of Python’s standard libraries.  
- Automating file, date, and math operations.  
- Writing professional, reusable, human-friendly scripts.
