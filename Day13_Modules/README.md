Day 13 – Modules

Modules in Python help us split big programs into smaller parts.  
They make our code clean, reusable, and easy to manage — like using different boxes for different tools.

Programs

1. temp_converter_demo.py — Converts temperature using "temp_convert.py".  
   Concept: Keep conversion logic separate and import when needed.

2. random_quiz.py — Picks a random question from "questions.py".  
   Concept: Store data in a module and use it in the main program.

3. stats_demo.py — Finds mean and median using "stats_utils.py".  
   Concept: Reuse helper functions through a custom utility module.

4. datetime_logger.py — Logs user actions with timestamps.  
   Concept: Uses Python’s built-in datetime and main guard feature.

5. notes_manager.py(+ "file_utils.py") — Mini notes app with timestamps.  
   Concept: Combines file handling and modular design in one small project.

Summary

> How to create and import custom modules.
> How to use standard modules like datetime.
> The importance of code reusability and organization in real projects.
